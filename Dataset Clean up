#This a dataset I downloaded from Kaggle 
## Cleaned the dataset using Microsoft Excel
## I removed duplicate values and filled up empty cells with appropriate values
## I used Excel formulas and commands to get this data set cleaned up
## I shared screenshots of the cleaning process in a file in Google Docs (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bjYVJJSxQ7j3NZByoDREFOqfNdd4Alp2k6n4valIup8/edit?usp=sharing)
